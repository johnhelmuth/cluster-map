# cluster-map

Cluster Map is an attempt to dynamically capture the star system cluster information from my Space Opera RPG Game In Dire Straits.

I decided I needed to learn a new front-end framework, picked Vue.js to do so.

I converted the project to build with Nuxt.js, so I could implement easy server-side APIs (and to
get SSR pages.)

This is another learning project for me.
